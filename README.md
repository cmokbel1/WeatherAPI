- Weather API for cities around the world!
- users can enter any city name and receive current weather as well as 5 day forecast
- 3 spereate API queries provide the user with a wide array of information
- selected information was based on assignment requirements 
- also added information i personally wanted to display
- html is designed with containers but most of the filled in information is done through js 
- 5 day forecasts are displayed in an unordered list as cards
- used bootstrap to stylize the css layout
